**Companies Not Selected**:

1. **Neurons**:

2. **Bware Labs**:
   - **Reason for Not Being Selected**: Bware Labs, though promising with its blockchain technology in decentralized API solutions, faces a competitive market. While blockchain's future outlook appears bright, Ama Care's focus on AI-driven healthcare offers a more immediate high-growth potential.
