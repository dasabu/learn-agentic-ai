       "As of June 2025, several AI agent frameworks have emerged, each offering unique capabilities for developing intelligent systems:\n",
       "\n",
       "- **AutoGen**: Developed by Microsoft, AutoGen is an open-source framework designed for creating multi-agent AI applications. Its architecture comprises three layers: Core, AgentChat, and Extensions, facilitating scalable and distributed agent networks. AutoGen also provides tools like AutoGen Bench for performance assessment and AutoGen Studio for no-code agent development. ([ibm.com](https://www.ibm.com/think/insights/top-ai-agent-frameworks?utm_source=openai))\n",
       "\n",
       "- **LangChain**: LangChain enables developers to build complex AI workflows by chaining prompts, memory, and tools into coherent pipelines. It supports multiple large language models (LLMs) and APIs, making it suitable for applications like conversational agents and retrieval-augmented systems. ([lekha-bhan88.medium.com](https://lekha-bhan88.medium.com/top-5-agentic-ai-frameworks-to-watch-in-2025-9d51b2b652c0?utm_source=openai))\n",
       "\n",
       "- **LangGraph**: LangGraph utilizes graph-based architectures to manage stateful AI workflows, ideal for orchestrating complex multi-agent systems. It offers a visual approach to managing agent interactions and dependencies, beneficial for industries requiring precise task execution, such as healthcare and supply chain management. ([blog.mechcloud.io](https://blog.mechcloud.io/top-5-ai-agent-frameworks-in-2025?utm_source=openai))\n",
       "\n",
       "- **CrewAI**: CrewAI focuses on multi-agent collaboration, treating agents as a \"crew\" of \"workers\" to promote teamwork in AI systems. Its role-based architecture is particularly useful for applications demanding human-AI or multi-agent cooperation, such as virtual assistants and personalized learning platforms. ([blog.mechcloud.io](https://blog.mechcloud.io/top-5-ai-agent-frameworks-in-2025?utm_source=openai))\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Eliza**: Eliza is an open-source, Web3-friendly AI agent framework that integrates seamlessly with blockchain applications. It allows developers to create AI agents capable of interacting with smart contracts and blockchain data, expanding the potential of decentralized applications. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06781?utm_source=openai))\n",
       "\n",
       "- **AutoAgent**: AutoAgent is a fully automated, zero-code framework enabling users to create and deploy LLM agents through natural language alone. It comprises components like Agentic System Utilities, LLM-powered Actionable Engine, Self-Managing File System, and Self-Play Agent Customization module, facilitating efficient agent development without coding requirements. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05957?utm_source=openai))\n",
       "\n",
       "- **AgentLite**: AgentLite is a lightweight library designed to simplify the creation and evaluation of task-oriented LLM agent systems. It offers a user-friendly platform for innovating LLM agent reasoning, architectures, and applications, enhancing the development of multi-agent systems.
